FamilySunburst
==============

A sunburst diagramm to visualise a genealogical tree implemented in Processing. The diagram was designed to visualise a genealogical tree starting from one ancestor (name in the middle). Rings in one colour nuance represent one generation of the family. The inner ring of one colour nuance contains the descendants and the outer ring their partners. The next ring outwards contains the children of the descendants.
